# lxardoscope_wemos_d1_mini
this is a single channel low frequency oscilloscope using a wemos d1 minis internal adc. you can use it just with the board itself but i have made a little daughterboard which contains a screw terminal, a capacitor for ac coupling, a switch to toggle between the ac and dc coupling and a bridge where you can add a resistor for meassuring higher voltages (it survives 5v, do this at your own risk as it is specified as 3.3v max). the code is still work in progress and currently just a hack job of the original sample code that came with the lxardoscope download package.
