I created this little daughterboard/shield to be stacked ontop of the wemos d1 mini to provide me with the option to toggle between ac and dc coupling. please excuse my terrible solder job here, I used a usb soldering iron which is very low power. it also has the functionality to add an in line resisitor to prevent the esp from frying if you want to meassure higher voltages that 3.3v (in my experience it survives 5v too but do this at your own risk), simply remove the wire bridge and add a resistor there, the bridge is made with a lead from a 3mm led bent into shape. the schematic with the pins is as seen above (i also added labels for A0 and gnd so its easier to figure out)
